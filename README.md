- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @blacksmithMike. I am a student at BYU, Idaho, and I am working on my BS in Software Engineering.
- Iâ€™m interested in almost all things computers, and I am also working on a homestead rasing animals and fruits/veggies.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me further my learning, and my understanding of coding practices.
